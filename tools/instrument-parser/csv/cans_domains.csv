1,BEHAVIORAL/EMOTIONAL NEEDS DOMAIN,BEN,"The ratings in this section identify the behavioral health needs of the youth. While the CANS is not a diagnostic tool, it is designed to be consistent with diagnostic communication. In the DSM, a diagnosis is defined by a set of symptoms that is associated with either dysfunction or distress. This is consistent with the ratings of '2' or '3' as described by the action levels below.","What are the presenting social, emotional, and behavioral needs of the child/youth? ",,1,,No current need; no need for action or intervention.,"History or suspicion of problems; requires monitoring, watchful waiting, or preventive activities.",Problem is interfering with functioning; requires action or intervention to ensure that the need is addressed.,Problems are dangerous or disabling; requires immediate and/or intensive action.,,,Need
2,LIFE FUNCTIONING DOMAIN,LFD,"Life domains are the different arenas of social interaction found in the lives of children, youths, and their families. This domain rates how they are functioning in the individual, family, peer, school, and community realms. This section is rated using the needs scale and therefore will highlight any struggles the individual and family are experiencing.","How is the child/youth functioning in individual, family, peer, school, and community realms?

4,CULTURAL FACTORS DOMAIN,CUL,"These items identify linguistic or cultural issues for which service providers need to make accommodations (e.g., provide interpreter, finding therapist who speaks family's primary language, and/or ensure that a child/youth in placement has the opportunity to participate in cultural rituals associated with their cultural identity). Items in the Cultural Factors Domain describe difficulties that children and youth may experience or encounter as a result of their membership in any cultural group, and/or because of the relationship between members of that group and members of the dominant society. 
It is it important to remember when using the CANS that the family should be defined from the individual youth's perspective (i.e., who the individual describes as part of her/his family). The cultural issues in this domain should be considered in relation to the impact they are having on the life of the individual when rating these items and creating a treatment or service plan.

5,STRENGTHS DOMAIN,STR,"This domain describes the assets of the child/youth that can be used to advance healthy development. It is important to remember that strengths are NOT the opposite of needs.

Identifying areas where strengths can be built is a significant element of service planning. In these items the 'best' assets and resources available to the child/youth are rated based on how accessible and useful those strengths are. These are the only items that use the Strength Rating Scale with action levels.",What child/youth strengths can be used to support a need?,,1,,Well-developed or centerpiece strength; may be used as a protective factor and a centerpiece of a strength-based plan.,Useful strength is evident but requires some effort to maximize the strength. Strength might be used and built upon in treatment.,Strengths have been identified but require significant strength building efforts before they can be effectively utilized as part of a plan.,An area in which no current strength is identified; efforts are needed to identify potential strengths.,,,Strength
6,CAREGIVER RESOURCES AND NEEDS DOMAIN,CGV,"This section focuses on the strengths and needs of the caregiver. Caregiver ratings should be completed by household.

13,DYADIC CONSIDERATIONS,EDY,This section considers factors that impact the ways in which the caregiver/child dyad interacts. There is nothing that has more impact on a child than the way that their parent or caregiver interacts with them.
